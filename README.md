## Overview

**The Simple Fund** is a blockchain-powered platform that transforms traditional receivables funds into transparent, liquid, and globally accessible investments. Built on the Stellar blockchain, it addresses significant inefficiencies in the receivables financing market by tokenizing fund shares, automating distributions, and providing immediate liquidity.

Every year, trillions of dollars in receivables get trapped in slow, manual processesâ€”capital that could fuel growth but instead disappears into back-office inefficiencies. Our solution migrates the entire fund cycle onto the Stellar blockchain, turning fund shares into digital tokens that can be traded instantly on the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

* **$0.32 lost per $1,000** of revenue due to outdated data and manual errors
* **$13** to process a single invoice
* **3 weeks** average settlement time per operation
* **$7.2 million/year** in costs for large funds
* **Minimal liquidity** for investors with long lock-ups

### The Solution

**The Simple Fund** addresses these inefficiencies through:

1. **Tokenization** â€” Converting fund shares into fungible Stellar tokens
2. **On-Chain Registry** â€” Transparent registration of assignors and debtors
3. **Automated Distribution** â€” Smart contracts for seamless proportional returns
4. **Global Liquidity** â€” Instant trading capabilities on the Stellar DEX

The result is a fast, auditable, and scalable B2B SaaS model for fund managers.

## Key Features

- **For Fund Managers**:
  - Real-time dashboards replace manual reconciliation
  - "Hard freeze" functionality for one-click issuance and transfer control
  - On-chain compliance and audit trails

- **For Investors**:
  - Tokenized shares stored in personal wallets
  - Public issuance history and transparent fund performance
  - Immediate secondary liquidity through the Stellar DEX

- **For Consultants**:
  - 100% digital onboarding with auditable approval trails
  - Streamlined assignor and debtor registration
  - Transparent fund creation process

## Architecture

The Simple Fund connects key players in the receivables market through blockchain:

- **Assignor (Originator)** â€” Generates receivables and sells them to the fund for immediate capital
- **Debtor (Payer)** â€” Responsible for paying the receivable at maturity
- **Fund Manager (DTVM)** â€” Creates and manages funds, approves registrations
- **Consultant** â€” Introduces new assignors and debtors to the fund
- **Investor** â€” Purchases tokenized fund shares and receives proportional returns
