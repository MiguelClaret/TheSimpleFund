## Introduction

Every year, trillions in receivables get stuck in slow, opaque processes—capital that could fuel growth but instead disappears into back-office inefficiencies. The receivables fund industry suffers from high operational costs, manual reconciliation, and chronic illiquidity for investors.

Take agribusiness as an example: a farming company sells goods on credit to a trading firm. In need of immediate capital, it sells the receivable to a fund at a discount. On paper, the flow is simple: assignor → fund → debtor → investors. In practice, however, this process gets bogged down by manual KYC, fragmented data, reconciliation delays, and a lack of transparency.

**The Simple Fund** emerges as the first platform to migrate this flow entirely onto the Stellar blockchain—turning fund shares into digital tokens, automating distributions, and providing instant liquidity in a global market.

## The Problem

* **\$0.32 lost per \$1,000** of revenue due to outdated data and manual errors.
* **\$13** to process a single invoice.
* **3 weeks** average settlement time per operation.
* **\$7.2 million/year** in costs for large funds.
* **Minimal liquidity** for investors, with long lock-ups.

These bottlenecks make the traditional system expensive, slow, and unattractive in a world that demands speed and transparency.

## The Solution

**The Simple Fund** addresses these structural inefficiencies with blockchain infrastructure:

1. **Tokenization** — Managers convert fund shares into fungible Stellar tokens.
2. **On-Chain Registry** — Consultants register assignors and debtors with full transparency.
3. **Automated Distribution** — Smart contracts handle proportional returns seamlessly.
4. **Global Liquidity** — Shares become tradable instantly on the Stellar DEX.

The result: fast, auditable, and scalable operations delivered through a **B2B SaaS model** for fund managers.

## Global Impact

* **For Managers**: Real-time dashboards replace manual reconciliation; “hard freeze” gives one-click issuance and transfer control.
* **For Investors**: Shares stored in their own wallet, with public issuance history and immediate secondary liquidity.
* **For Consultants**: 100% digital onboarding with auditable on-chain approval trails.

With Stellar’s capacity to process transactions in **\~5 seconds at a cost of \$0.00001**, micro-operations become globally viable—positioning The Simple Fund for rapid international scale.

## Conclusion

**The Simple Fund** is not just a platform—it is a new standard for receivables funds. By combining **tokenization, smart contracts, and global liquidity**, it transforms a traditionally expensive and inefficient process into one that is **transparent, liquid, and global**.

Backed by Stellar’s proven infrastructure, the solution aligns with the trillion-dollar growth of receivables financing and the rapid expansion of tokenized assets worldwide.
