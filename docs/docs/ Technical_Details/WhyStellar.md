# WHY Stellar?

## **Introduction**

The **Simple Fund** leverages the **Stellar blockchain** to revolutionize the receivables fund market by providing transparency, speed, and liquidity. Stellar technologies are at the core of our solution, making the product scalable, cost-effective, and efficient. This section outlines why **Stellar** is essential for the success of the project, and how it enables **real-time, low-cost transactions** in a way that traditional systems cannot match.

## **Practical Execution Plan**

The execution of **The Simple Fund** is built around the use of **Stellar's blockchain** to address the core inefficiencies in the receivables fund market. Stellar’s capabilities enable the **tokenization of fund shares**, **smart contracts for automated distributions**, and **global liquidity** via the **Stellar DEX**.

1. **On-chain tokenization of receivables**: We use Stellar’s low-cost infrastructure to **tokenize receivables** (assets) and transform them into **fungible digital tokens**, representing real-world assets. This process makes the receivables more easily tradable and liquid.

2. **Real-time settlement**: With Stellar’s **low-cost infrastructure**, payments are processed instantly and with low fees (approximately **\$0.00001 per transaction**). This allows funds to be settled in **real-time**, eliminating the inefficiencies that traditionally plague the industry.

3. **Automated distribution via smart contracts**: We use **smart contracts** to ensure that once the receivable is paid, the funds are **automatically distributed** to investors in proportion to their share of the fund.

4. **Global liquidity through Stellar DEX**: Investors can trade their **fund shares on the Stellar DEX**, giving them access to secondary liquidity markets.


## **Does the Product Work?**

Yes, the product works as intended. We have **deployed the core functionalities** on the **Stellar testnet**, and it has been thoroughly tested for:

* **Security**: Ensuring that the funds and transactions are secure and immutable.
* **Scalability**: Stellar’s infrastructure can process thousands of transactions per second, allowing us to scale to manage larger funds and investor bases.
* **Usability**: The platform’s design is focused on simplicity and ease of use for investors, consultants, and fund managers, ensuring a smooth experience.

### **Proof of Concept**

The **MVP** has already been tested in a **controlled environment**, simulating real-world transactions, and has demonstrated successful tokenization, transaction finality, and automated fund distributions. The **Stellar blockchain** proves to be highly capable of handling the necessary functions with minimal cost and high reliability.


## **Are Stellar Technologies Essential?**

Yes, Stellar technologies are **essential** for the success of **The Simple Fund**. Here’s why:

1. **Low Cost**: Stellar’s transaction costs are **extremely low**, making it possible to conduct micro-transactions (e.g., tokenizing small receivables) without incurring high fees. This is crucial for the viability of our solution, as traditional financial systems would make such operations too expensive.

2. **High Speed**: Stellar’s **transaction speed (3-5 seconds)** enables real-time settlement of receivables. This is a key feature for ensuring **liquidity** and enabling **secondary trading** on the **Stellar DEX**.

3. **Built-in Compliance**: Stellar has been designed with **compliance** in mind, supporting features like **KYC/AML** and **transaction auditing**, which are critical for operating in the highly-regulated financial industry.

4. **Interoperability**: Stellar offers **interoperability with other networks and tokens**, making it easy for our platform to engage with various global financial systems, offering **multi-currency support** and enabling us to expand beyond the initial market.


## **Is the Project Active on the Testnet?**

Yes, the project is actively running on the **Stellar testnet**. The testnet serves as an environment where all features, from **receivable tokenization** to **automated fund distributions**, are being tested before deployment on the **mainnet**. We have conducted **multiple rounds of testing** to ensure the platform performs as expected under various real-world scenarios.

### **Key Testnet Activities**:

* **Tokenization testing**: Successfully tokenized receivables and issued shares to test user wallets.
* **Smart contract testing**: Deployed smart contracts for automated distribution and tested them to ensure compliance with predefined rules.
* **Transaction performance testing**: Evaluated transaction speeds and costs to ensure the system’s scalability and efficiency.


## **Conclusion**

Stellar’s **blockchain** is essential to the success of **The Simple Fund**. It provides the **speed, low-cost transactions, and scalability** needed to transform the receivables fund industry. By using Stellar, we can offer a **transparent, efficient, and globally accessible solution**, with the ability to scale and adapt to the needs of the global market. With the project already active on the **Stellar testnet**, we are confident in its capabilities and excited about the next steps to deploy it on the **mainnet**.
