# Market Context

&nbsp; To understand our proposal, it is essential to know how **Receivables Investment Funds (FIDCs)** work and the role of each participant in this ecosystem.  

&nbsp; In simple terms, a receivable is a financial instrument that represents a future payment. The fund works as a mechanism to anticipate this value, offering immediate liquidity in exchange for a discount.

## Key players in a receivables fund

- **Assignor (Originator)**  
  The entity that generates the receivable — for example, a farmer issuing an agricultural note (CPR in Brazil).  
  They sell this receivable to the fund in exchange for upfront capital.

- **Debtor (Payer)**  
  The one responsible for paying the receivable at maturity — for example, a supermarket or an agribusiness company that purchased the production.  
  The debtor’s payment fuels the fund, which then distributes resources to investors.

- **Manager (DTVM)**  
  The entity responsible for creating and managing the fund.  
  It approves registrations, issues digital shares, records receivables, and ensures that payments are delivered to investors.  
  The manager plays a central role in governance.

- **Consultant**  
  Acts as a scout, introducing new assignors and debtors to the fund.  
  Serves as a bridge between the producer, the payer, and the manager.

- **Investor**  
  Buys the fund’s shares (quotas).  
  They are entitled to receive part of the returns according to their participation.  
  Today, investors depend on periodic reports and manual distribution processes.

## How the fund cycle works

1. The consultant registers an assignor and a debtor.  
2. The manager (DTVM) validates the data and creates the fund.  
3. The fund issues shares (quotas) that are purchased by investors.  
4. The assignor delivers the receivables to the fund.  
5. The debtor pays the receivable at maturity.  
6. The manager distributes the payments proportionally to the investors.  

## Visual overview of the process

&nbsp; The diagram below provides a visual summary of how an FIDC works.  

- The **assignor (supplier/producer)** delivers goods or services to the **debtors (buyers)** and, in return, receives a credit instrument — the receivable.  
- Instead of waiting for future payment, the assignor can sell this receivable to the **FIDC**, which pays immediately with a discount.  
- The FIDC, in turn, is funded by **investors**, who buy shares of the fund and finance the operation.  
- When the debtor pays the receivable, the value returns to the fund and is distributed proportionally among the investors.  

&nbsp; This model enables the conversion of future receivables into immediate liquidity, but today it still relies heavily on manual processes and lacks transparency.

## Practical example

&nbsp; An agricultural company sells R$ 200,000 worth of products to a **supermarket**, with payment due in 30 days.  
In need of immediate working capital, it sells this receivable for R$ 180,000 to a fund — a 10% discount in exchange for instant liquidity.  

- The agricultural company is the **Assignor**  
- The supermarket is the **Debtor**  
- The fund is the **buyer** of the receivable  

## Current challenges

&nbsp; This process is still manual, bureaucratic, and opaque.  
- Investors only receive occasional reports.  
- Distributions require significant manual effort.  

&nbsp; Our solution aims to address these limitations by migrating this entire cycle to the Stellar blockchain, ensuring transparency, speed, and liquidity.
